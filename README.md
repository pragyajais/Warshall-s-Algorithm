# Warshall-s-Algorithm

Takes an non-weighted adjacency matrix of vertices in a graph (A) and computes the Transitivity Closure (B+) of the matrix.
The Transitivity Closure of the matrix is then used to compute Kleen's Closure (B_star).

Both the transitivity closure and kleen's closure are used as arguments to later compute the Simple Precedence Matrix.
